Step 1: Ask â€” What is the Goal?

Search-based? (Find an anagram, substring, pattern)

Validation-based? (Check palindrome, balanced brackets)

Transformation-based? (Reverse words, compress string, remove duplicates)

ðŸ‘‰ This narrows the category immediately.

ðŸ§© Step 2: Identify Common Patterns

Here are the most common patterns in string problems (with examples):

1. Sliding Window

When problem asks for substring or subarray with conditions.

Ex:

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Minimum Window Substring

Find Anagrams in String

âš¡ Trick: Use two pointers (left, right) and frequency arrays.

2. Two Pointers

When problem is about comparison from both ends.

Ex:

Palindrome check (left vs right)

Remove duplicates in-place

Reverse words or characters in string

âš¡ Trick: Always think of start and end moving toward middle.

3. Frequency Count

When problem is about matching characters.

Ex:

Anagram check

First Unique Character

Valid Anagram

âš¡ Trick: Use int[26] for lowercase or int[128] for ASCII.

4. Dynamic Programming (DP)

When problem asks for longest subsequence / substring.

Ex:

Longest Palindromic Substring (expand center is also O(NÂ²))

Longest Common Subsequence / Substring

âš¡ Trick: Use DP table for overlapping subproblems.
